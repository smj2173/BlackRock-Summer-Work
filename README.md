Attached is my final presentation from my Summer 2022 Internship at BlackRock in the Aladdin Product Group. 
In lieu of the live demo and codebase explained in the PowerPoint (the code and product is property of BlackRock now that I have completed my internship), I have attached some notes meant to accompany and further explicate the final presentation findings.
